# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-using-MNIST-Dataset
This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for image classification tasks. The model is built using the Keras deep learning library with a focus on achieving high accuracy while maintaining code readability.

### Key Features:
1. Digit Recognition: The model can effectively identify handwritten digits from images or input data with a high degree of precision
2. Optimal Recognition Accuracy:  The machine learning model excels in accurately recognizing handwritten digits, ensuring consistent and dependable performance
3. Efficient Model Architecture: The CNN architecture utilizes convolutional layers with appropriate filter sizes and pooling layers for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
4. Data Preprocessing:  The MNIST dataset undergoes essential preprocessing steps, including normalization and reshaping, to ensure optimal training performance.
5. Training & Evaluation: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the categorical crossentropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification problems like digit recognition. Metrics like accuracy and loss are monitored during training to track progress and identify potential issues.


### Custom Input Testing: 
Users can test custom input images against the model to evaluate its performance. The provided "digits" folder contains custom input images formatted at 28x28 pixels, enabling seamless uploading of handwritten digits for recognition. This feature facilitates real-world scenario testing and validation of the model's accuracy with user-generated data."
